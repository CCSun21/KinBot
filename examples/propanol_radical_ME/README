This example runs searches for all reactions for 
the propanoyl radical (one well only). The search 
includes conformer searches, high-level calculations
and hindered rotor calculations and puts everything
in a MESS input file, which is automatically run.

Helium is use as bath gas molecule

Please note only one well has been written to MESS, 
no full PES will be available and the rate coefficients
will thus be off. This example is solely for demonstration
purposes. 
Also, KinBot does not search for barrierless steps, 
neither for van der Waals wells. 

The search finds 3 isomerization and 6 dissociation channels

To run this example, type "kinbot propanoyl.json &"
After it is finished:
1. You can visualize the results with "pesviewer pesviewer.inp"
2. The MESS results are in the me/ directory
