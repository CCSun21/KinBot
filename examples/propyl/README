This example runs searches for all reactions for 
the propyl radical (one well only). The search
includes conformer searches, high-level calculations
and hindered rotor calculations.

This provides an example of input file where the initial
species is specified in cartesian coordinates via the
structure `keyword`.

The search finds 1 isomerization and 4 dissociation channels

To run this example, type "kinbot propyl.json"
After it is finished:
1. You can visualize the results with "pesviewer pesviewer.inp"
